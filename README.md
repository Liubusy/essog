simple tornado-motor e-commerce

I want to thank all those who have helped me: [stackoverflow][1], [tornado][2], [mongodb][3] communities.

Dependecies:
=====

The project is a simple e-commerce (without payement system. since it dont exists here in Algeria), it will depend one some libraries:

 1. [Tornado][4] : of course, the server, the framework ;)
 2. [Motor][5] (of course Pymongo) : for non-blocking access for Mongodb.
 3. [Passlib][6] : for hashing password. (you can use Bcrypt or Scrypt, but i have used windows, so they dident compile on my machine).
 4. [PIL][7] : for pictures operations.
 5. [Python-Amazon-Simple-Product-Api][8] : for making requests to Amazon.
 6. [SimpleEncode][9] : to use strings to encode another string.
 7. [User Agents][10] : to force user to use HTML5
